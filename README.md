# Valorant-Instalocker
In this repository you can find a valorant instalocker that automatically locks your agents for you

It was created in Python and the only requirement you need except having Python installed is "pyautogui" because this detects pictures of your agents and clicks on them

Step 1: Run "tracker" to get the Middle of the Lock button location and write it in "box_coords.txt" (X first row, Y second row)

Step 2: Take a Screenshot of the Agent Select Screen in Fullscreen and save it while no agent is chosen yet (I recommend doing this in a private match)

Step 3: Add every Agent in "agent_names.txt" (Preferably in alphabetical order but not necessary)

Step 4: Save a Screenshot of the agents you want to use (or all of them) with their name written in lowercase in this folder, for example: reyna.png (Should look like the agent example)

Step 5: Start "tracker_for_locker" while having the Screenshot of the Agent Select Screen opened in Fullscreen and wait till it closes automatically (may take a minute for slower PCs)

Step 5.1: The tracker closes by itself when it finishes, then you can close the Screenshot

Step 6: Start the "locker" then enter the agent and the program will instalock for you!

Step 7: Have fun!

Some in Game stuff like agent portraits may change over time, when that happens just repeat the steps till everything works again
The Randomizer is the same to set up and it will change the agent you randomly instalock after every game
The mouse should not be moved in the agent select because otherwise it may not instalock correctly
